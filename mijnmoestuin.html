        <h3>Winner Golden Dot Awards 2021: Propedeuse Incentive Award</h3>
        <p>At CMD Amsterdam, we have the Golden Dot Awards every year. We were then nominated for and won the
            Propedeuse Encouragement Award.</p>

        <p class="ondertitel2">During the Passion Project, we were tasked with developing a product/service that
            expressed our passion and allowed us to make an individual happy. We both had a passion for plants and
            the
            individual, Wilma, happened to have this as well. Wilma had a number of problems where she needed help
            in
            her garden and in doing so, we wanted to develop an app that could provide help with these problems. Our
            further goal was to make vegetable gardening even more fun!
        </p>

        <h3>Research</h3>
        <p> We did research by interviewing and observing the behaviour of our individual Wilma. She had different
            needs she wanted to know which plants wouldn’t take up much space in width but more in height, discover
            new plants and new recipes to use her harvest. She also had problems with snails and a new interest in
            small fruit trees as you can see many different things to keep in mind so we started sketching and
            prototyping.</p>


        <h3>First Sketches</h3>

        <h3>Illustrations</h3>
        <p>Me and my teammate Esther both had a passion for illustration that we wanted to explore we decided to
            make the illustrations for the app for this reason. These are a view of the plants we illustrated.</p>

        <h3>Final Prototype</h3>
        <p>We went through many protoptypes after that from Lo-fi to Me-fi and Hi-fi, through testing and many
            rounds of peer feedback and expert reviews we came to this end-result. (The video is in dutch but you
            can still get an overview of the app).</p>

        <h3>Result</h3>
        <p>‘Mijn Moestuin’ is an app designed to make vegetable gardening more fun and easier. In ‘Mijn Moestuin’,
            you create your own digital garden, to which you can add plants. The app then helps you with various
            tasks. Think of how much water you should give your plants based on the weather. Furthermore, you get
            different tips, discover new plants, find cooking inspiration for your harvest and you can even keep a
            photo timeline of your plant's growth. In the end, we achieved an end result that was tailored to the
            needs and problems the individual had. We solved this with the various fun features. We also achieved
            our goal of giving a playful look to the app. We did this through illustrations, animations and fresh
            colors. Wilma, our user, was very satisfied with the end result and felt that the needs and problems she
            had were well listened to. A successful end result!</p>

        <h3>Feedback Valina Convent</h3>
        <p>"I find it clever how you, driven in your desire to create an app that supports the user in her vegetable
            gardening passion, have designed a product that actually matches the behavior and wishes of how the user
            gardens. You showed that you understand what is most important to her and incorporated that into the
            home screen and the whole further design of 'Mijn Moestuin'. You also made the design and animations in
            the style of Wilma and used the tools like Figma to achieve this. Independent, driven and user centred
            design."</p>
