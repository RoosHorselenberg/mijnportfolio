        <p class="ondertitel">During my short internship at CMD Agency, I was given an additional assignment to
            improve the information architecture of www.cmdmethods.nl. The client Sonja Rouwhorst felt that the
            website could use an update and some new features. Together we came up with a solution that improved the
            user experience and had a playful look. This website is still in the process of being coded.</p>

        <h3>Task</h3>
        <p> A redesign of the information architecture and user interface for the CMD Method Cards website. And
            addition of new features and illustrations. Sonja and I communicated very well about what was needed to
            improve the site. Some students for example didnâ€™t know what some of the scales meant so we made a
            filter screen that explained them. And there was no search function which made it difficult for the user
            to find a certain method when they need it. We solved those problems with our solutions and more, you
            can read about it below.</p>


        <h3>Before and After</h3>
        <p>To give you a quick overview of the changes I made this is the before and after of the homepage of
            cmdmethods.nl As you can see through minor adjustments to the site, as a whole it has taken on a clearer
            and fresher appearance</p>

        <h3>Detail-Page</h3>
        <p>To give the user more feed forward and the feeling of flipping through a card deck you can now see the
            card you will be flipping to when you click on the next button.</p>

        <h3>New Illustrations</h3>
        <p>To give the website a more playful and fun look, we decided to create more illustrations based on those
            previously created for the card game by Laura Henneke. Each category of cards will now have its own
            visual that represents the brand of cmd methods throughout the site.</p>

        </figure>

        <h3>New Filter Screen</h3>
        <p>Because it can sometimes be a struggle to find a method to reach your goal we added a new filter system
            which will match you to methods that will help you the most.</p>

        <h3>Suprise Cards</h3>
        <p>Sonja and I wanted to find a way for users to find new research methods in a spontaneous way. The new
            feature are these surprise cards. When you flip them over you get a random card, this adds to the
            playful feel of the site. We have three different categories:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Feeling Lucky: A method chosen from the entire site;
            </li>
            <li>
                In the Spot Light: A method we feel deserves more attention and to be used more;
            </li>
            <li>
                Most Pinned: As you can pin your favourite methods the most pinned of the site will be shown when you flip this card;
            </li>
        </ul>
        <figure>

        <h3>Responsive</h3>
        <p>Lastly we made some changes to what the site looks like on different screen sizes.</p>
